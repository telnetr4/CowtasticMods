Introduction:
This is a plugin for Cowtastic Cafe v 1.1.0.0 that is powered by the BepInEx 5 framework.
This plugin allows you to scale the Barista.
This plugin is intended for use by players who have a basic understanding of modding and are comfortable with installing and configuring BepInEx 5 plugins.

This mod has optional SKTools compatability.

Installation:

1. Make sure you have BepInEx 5 installed on your system. If you don't, follow the instructions provided by https://github.com/telnetr4/CowtasticMods#install-bepinex
2. Extract the contents of the archive into the BepInEx/plugins folder in your game's directory.
3. Launch the game and check if the plugin is working properly.
4. If the config file telnet.bigbarista.cfg appears in BepInEx/config, that means it's working!

Configuration:
This plugin has configurable settings, located in the BepInEx/config folder. You can modify these settings using a text editor like Notepad or Visual Studio Code.
You will probably only want to modify ScaleFact.

Uninstallation:
To uninstall the plugin, simply delete the plugin files from the BepInEx/plugins folder in your game's directory.

Troubleshooting:
If you encounter any issues with the plugin, try the following steps:

-Check if the plugin is compatible with your game version.
-Check if the plugin is conflicting with any other plugins you have installed.
-Check if the plugin is installed correctly and in the right folder.
-Check the plugin's documentation or readme file for any troubleshooting tips.
-Scream in frustration.
-Check that you have installed the correct version of BepInEx 5.
-Check the indepth tutorial: https://github.com/telnetr4/CowtasticMods#install-bepinex

Bugs:
-There could be a memory leak. Probably OK as long as you don't switch back to the main menu too many times. If it happens, restart the game.
-Position offsets may need tuning

Planned Features (If I ever get to it):
-Add the option and systems to modify/add gameplay mechanics related to scale

Introduction:
This is a plugin for Cowtastic Cafe v 1.0.0.24 that is powered by the BepInEx 5 framework.
This (rough) plugin allows you to control things using your keyboard.
This plugin is intended for use by players who have a basic understanding of modding and are comfortable with installing and configuring BepInEx 5 plugins.

Installation:

1. Make sure you have BepInEx 5 installed on your system. If you don't, follow the instructions provided by BepInEx's documentation to install it.
2. Extract the contents of the archive into the BepInEx/plugins folder in your game's directory.
3. Launch the game and check if the plugin is working properly.
4. If the config file telnet.HotkeyHelper.cfg appears in BepInEx/config, that means it's working!

Configuration:
This plugin has configurable settings, located in the BepInEx/config folder. You can modify these settings using a text editor like Notepad or Visual Studio Code.
The config file is where you can reset keys using Unity Keycodes (http://answers.unity.com/answers/762252/view.html). Hotkeys defaults are currently set to allow one-handed use.

Uninstallation:
To uninstall the plugin, simply delete the plugin files from the BepInEx/plugins folder in your game's directory.

Troubleshooting:
If you encounter any issues with the plugin, try the following steps:

-Check if the plugin is compatible with your game version.
-Check if the plugin is conflicting with any other plugins you have installed.
-Check if the plugin is installed correctly and in the right folder.
-Check the plugin's documentation or readme file for any troubleshooting tips.
-Scream in frustration.
-Check that you have installed the correct version of BepInEx 5.
-Make sure your game is using the unstripped DLLs.

Bugs:
-This mod has very poor performance. Do not be surprised if your game bogs down when starting a new game.
-No pause button.

Planned Features (If I ever get to it):
-rewrite the whole damn thing. I learned a lot from modding this, and I think I know a better way to do it.

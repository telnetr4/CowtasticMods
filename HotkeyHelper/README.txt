This is a plugin for Cowtastic Cafe v 1.1.0.0 that is powered by the BepInEx 5 framework.
This plugin allows you to control pouring, milking and resetting/submitting drinks using your keyboard.
This plugin is intended for use by players who have a basic understanding of modding and are comfortable with installing and configuring BepInEx 5 plugins.

This mod has optional SKTools compatability. If installed, you can press ` to open/close the Sktoolbox console. Possible Sktoolbox console commands are listed under the `help` command.

2. Extract the contents of the archive into the BepInEx/plugins folder in your game's directory.
3. Launch the game and check if the plugin is working properly.
4. If the config file telnet.HotkeyHelper.cfg appears in BepInEx/config, that means it's working! If it doesn't, check the troubleshooting section.

This plugin has configurable settings, located in the BepInEx/config folder. You can modify these settings using a text editor like Notepad or Visual Studio Code.
The config file is where you can reset keys using Unity Keycodes (https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html). Hotkeys defaults are currently set to allow one-handed use.
